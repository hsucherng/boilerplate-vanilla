# Vanilla boilerplate

Good ol' vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

To "set it up":

1. Make a copy of the `dev` folder and paste it wherever you want your development files to be.
2. Check the following files:
    - `index.html` - search for `Website Name` and change it to the name of the website that you are developing.
    - `style.css` - at the top of the file, change `Website Name` to the name of the website that you are developing.
3. That's it! You are now ready to proceed with building your website.
