# Vanilla boilerplate

Good ol' vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

Remember to change the `Website Title` inside the `<title>` tag within `index.html`, as well as `[Website Title]` inside `style.css`.

All plugins and libraries should have their minified scripts appended into `externals.min.js` in order to keep the number of requests down to a minimum.
